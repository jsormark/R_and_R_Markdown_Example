# R_and_R_Markdown_Example
To further showcase R code and in this case utilization of R Markdown, for the purposes of knitting an output report file, economic data analysis related to companysize and expenditure on R&amp;D was conducted and presented.

# Overview
The current project was conducted to further present R code examples and the utilization of R Markdown. The current data utilized was sourced from the R wooldridge library which represented economic data related to 32 companies. The analysis conducted wanted to understand the relationship, if any, between R&D spend and company size. The analysis looked to incorporate linear regressions with visual analysis components, histogram and scatter plots, as well as a detailed mathematical analysis of the data. This sample will look to present the R code utilized for the interpertation and analysis of the data and will not be covered here.
